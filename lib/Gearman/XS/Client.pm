Gearman::XS::Client - Perl client for gearman using libgearman

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Gearman::XS qw(:constants);

  $ret = $client->add_server($host, $port);
  if ($ret != GEARMAN_SUCCESS)
  {
    printf(STDERR "%s\n", $client->error());
    exit(1);
  }

  # single client interface
  ($ret, $result) = $client->do("reverse", 'teststring');
  if ($ret == GEARMAN_SUCCESS)
  {
    printf("Result=%s\n", $result);
  }

  # background client interface
  ($ret, $job_handle) = $client->do_background('reverse', 'teststring);
  if ($ret != GEARMAN_SUCCESS)
  {
    printf(STDERR "%s\n", $client->error());
    exit(1);
  }

  # concurrent client interface
  ($ret, $task) = $client->add_task('reverse', 'test1');
